# fastai-coursev3-colab

Contains fastai course-v3 notebooks modified to run on Google Colab, with:

1st lesson notebook: 
- Necessary setup of the vm with the required frameworks
- Modifications on the method calls in cells

2nd lesson notebooks:
- Switched to just using the Colab setup script, found on the course notes, which makes things pretty much easier and neat.
