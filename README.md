# fastai-coursev3-colab

Contains fastai course-v3 notebooks modified to run on Google Colab:

1st lesson notebook has the necessary setup of the vm with the required frameworks. 
Then on the further lesson notebooks; I switched to just using the Colab setup script after finding it on the course forum, which made the runtime setup pretty much easy and neat.
